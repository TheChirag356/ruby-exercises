# My Ruby Solutions for The Odin Project

## About this Repository

This repository serves as a place to showcase my solutions for the Ruby exercises provided by The Odin Project. It contains a series of directories, each corresponding to a set of exercises from different lessons in the Ruby course.

The Odin Project's Ruby course focuses on guiding learners through various aspects of Ruby programming, and these exercises are intended to reinforce your understanding and skills. It's important to note that you should attempt these exercises only after being directed to do so in the assignment of the corresponding Ruby lesson. For example, if you have just completed the Basic Data Types lesson, focus on the exercises in the `1_data_types` folder for now.
## Cloning and Setup

To get started with this repository and explore my solutions, you can follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine by clicking the green "Code" button at the top right of the file list and copying the provided link. Then, run the following command in your terminal:

```shell
   git clone <link>
```

   This will create a folder named 'my-ruby-solutions' in the directory where you ran the command.

2. **Navigate to the Repository**: Change your current directory to the 'my-ruby-solutions' folder:

   ```shell
   cd my-ruby-solutions
   ```

3. **Install RSpec**: Before you begin working on the exercises, you'll need to install RSpec, a popular Ruby testing framework used in this repository to provide tests that check your solutions. Run the following command in your terminal:

   ```shell
   gem install rspec
   ```

   You should see a message indicating successful installation, such as "6 gems installed."

4. **Verify RSpec Installation**: Confirm that RSpec is correctly installed by running the following command:

   ```shell
   rspec
   ```

   You should receive a message that indicates that no examples were found. This indicates that RSpec is working as expected.

## Usage

Each directory within this repository corresponds to a specific set of exercises and contains its own README file with instructions for the exercises within that set. To work on a particular set of exercises, follow these general steps:

1. Navigate to the relevant directory:

   ```shell
   cd <exercise_directory>
   ```

   Replace `<exercise_directory>` with the name of the directory containing the exercises you want to complete.

2. Read the instructions provided in the README file for that exercise set. The instructions will guide you on what to do and what is expected.

3. Work on the exercises, write your Ruby code solutions, and save your files within the appropriate directory.

4. Use RSpec to test your solutions. Typically, the README file for each exercise set will provide instructions on how to run the tests.

5. Commit and Push: After completing the exercises and ensuring they pass the tests, commit your changes and push them to your forked repository.

Feel free to explore and contribute to this repository by adding your own solutions or improvements. Happy coding!
